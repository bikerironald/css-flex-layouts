# css-flex-layouts

CSS Flexbox is a layout module that makes it easy to design flexible and responsive layouts. It helps arrange items in a container, either in a row or column, and lets them grow, shrink, and align properly to fill available space.

Itâ€™s great for creating dynamic layouts without using floats or positioning.
